# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting telecom customer churn using a machine learning pipeline with a Random Forest classifier.

The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical problem in the telecom industry. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

This project aims to build a predictive model that can classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.
